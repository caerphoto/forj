# FORJ Forum
## Version 2

This is a complete rewrite of the forum using much of the experience I've gained over the past year doing web development as my full-time job. It is not compatible with Version 1, nor is it practical to upgrade from it.

Although I tried to write FORJ 1 with maintainability in mind, my lack of experience with web dev clearly shows, particularly in the rather ad-hoc frontend.

That frontend is where most of the improvements will be, making use of [Backbone.js] for a solid and more maintainable application framework, and [Mustache.js] to simplify page rendering.

I will also re-think the CSS, not just in terms of visual design but in how the rules, classes etc. are structured, again to make maintenance and customisation easier.

## Learning Experience

As things stand at the start of Version 2, I have no experience with Backbone.js beyond the first episode of the [PeepCode screencasts], so it will be an interesting learning experience.

In case it's of interest/help to others, I'll be writing about my experience on [my blog].
